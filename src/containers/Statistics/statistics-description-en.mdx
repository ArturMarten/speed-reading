The statistics show the data of all the exercises performed for both the table and the graph. In addition, it is possible to see aggregate statistics for a user group.

For reading exercises statistics, the data is processed in the following order:

1. Start with all user reading data

2. First, all values ​​where the reading speed exceeds 700 words per minute are filtered out (**if the user has selected "Remove unrealistic values"**)

3. This data is then used to find the mean reading speed and standard deviation (SD) and to filter out data that is outside the mean of 3 SD (**if the user has selected "Remove unrealistic values"**)

4. Filter out exercises with your texts (**if the user has chosen so**)

5. Only exercises with the first reading attempt are filtered (**if the user has chosen so**)

6. Filter out a specific reading exercise (**if the user has chosen so**)

7. Filter the data for the selected time period

8. Based on the final data, the mean and SD and the change are recalculated and displayed above the graph

For Schulte table exercise statistics, the data is processed as follows:

1. Start with the user's data for all Schulte table exercises

2. Find the mean and SD based on the symbol rate (symbols per minute) and filter out data outside the 3 SD mean (**if the user has selected "Remove unrealistic values"**)

3. Filter the data for the selected time period

4. Based on the data found, the mean and SD are recalculated and displayed above the graph

For the focus exercise statistics, the data is processed as follows:

1. Start with all the details of the user's concentration exercise

2. Find the mean and SD based on the result (%) and filter out data that is outside the mean of 3 SD (**if the user has selected "Remove unrealistic values"**)

3. Filter the data for the selected time period

4. From the data found, recalculate the mean of the result (%) and the SD and display it above the graph
